        Lorem <b>Ipsum is simply dummy</b> text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, <strong> also the leap into electronic typesetting</strong>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
        more recently with <i>desktop publishing software</i> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
